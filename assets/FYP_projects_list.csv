The current crime map can only show a given type of crimes in a given map. The enhanced map will be able to show multi-type of crimes and within a chosen period.  All Crime data will be available from the police (https://data.police.uk/) and there is an API (in C#) for your reference (https://github.com/SketchingDev/PoliceUK.NET).

Usually, one Excel sheet is maintained by the module leader and the other(s) is maintained by the course admin team. This spread of data creates a lot of issues because the number of students do not match or the marks for the same student are different across the sheets. In this project, you will create an application that takes two CSV files containing student records and it makes sure all the information in both files match. If there are any mismatches, the application has to output detailed errors to the relevant module/course admin teams. This project is PROGRAMMING FOCUSED. Ideally, you should have STRONG PROGRAMMING SKILLS and knowledge of Java. You should also be ready to learn some data analysis if necessary in order to understand the fields given to you in the files. "
99,Sara Hassan,General,?Micro-model? ? an application for modelling microservices ,1,"This project is PROGRAMMING FOCUSED.

For more details on microservices (https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html). They are similar to service-oriented architectures. A common way to model microservices is using domain-driven design concepts (a good place to understand more about them is this video: https://www.infoq.com/presentations/ddd-microservices-2016/). In this project, you will create an application which allows developers to click or drag-and-drop buttons in order to create microservice models similar to the one shown in the video. This is similar to making a tool for creating UML diagrams but this one is specifically for microservices. This project is PROGRAMMING FOCUSED. Ideally, you should have STRONG PROGRAMMING SKILLS particularly in GRAPHICAL LIBRARIES. This project will also require some background reading on domain-driven design and microservices."

Ideally, you should have STRONG PROGRAMMING AND TEXT PARSING skills.",Java ,"Currently, BCU staff in different schools/centres use SharePoint to share documents together. However, some duplications occur some times with the same information being sharing across different files. This can create communication gaps and lead to out of date sources of information. In this project, you will create an application that continually compares the content of tuple (i.e. 2 or more) documents for similarities. It is up to the owner of these documents after that to merge these files or not. This project is PROGRAMMING FOCUSED. Ideally, you should have STRONG PROGRAMMING SKILLS and knowledge of Java. You should also be ready to learn some parsing if necessary in order to understand how to look for multiple occurrences of keywords"
