Work with Kainos,"1) Procedurally generated racing game 
It can be time consuming when developing games to produce enough levels so that players have variety and not get bored. One solution is to procedurally generate levels so there is an infinite number and players get a new experience each time they play. 
A racing game which is able to dynamically generate tracks for players to race on. It should be possible to set the ?difficulty? of generated tracks. Consider adding AI players and/or multiplayer support so players can compete with other racers. ",2,,
Work with Kainos,"3) Tabletop Gaming companion app

Games such as the table-top wargame ?Star Wars legion? or the collectible card game ?The Lord of The Rings LCG? requires players to manually go through hundreds of cards and pick manually which they want to use. They also need to know all restrictions the game has in terms of which cards can be picked with which and also their points costs. This is complicated and requires all players to understand every rule, as expected this often leads to mistakes being made and users unintentionally breaking the rules.
Develop an Android app or mobile friendly web application to be used as a list/deck builder for either ?Star Wars legion? or ?The Lord of The Rings LCG?. 
The app should be a database of all cards available and automatically apply all deck/list building restrictions. Decks/lists should then be able to be saved, shared, printed, upvoted/liked and searchable so other players can view them for inspiration.  


The app will drastically reduce set up time for both games and build a community among players to share ideas. It could also be used to track which decks/lists are successful competitively.",2,Team worker,

Informative social media content identification,"Social media services (e.g. Twitter) can facilitate fast and wide spreading of information due to their large user base distributed all over the world. Considering a disaster or outbreak situation, we can use this ability in social media to receive updates quickly.  But, due to the volume of data available, it is a difficult and expensive task to manually extract informative contents to help decision making in such situations. Therefore, it is important to have a methodology which can automatically filter informative contents. 
Referring to the recent literature, different approaches were suggested for informative social media content identification, ranging from traditional machine learning-base methods [1] to deep neural network-based methods [2] [3].  It is important to have a good accuracy by such a system to support real world applications. Even though the deep neural network-based methods outperformed the traditional machine learning-base methods, neural networks require more training data for proper learning. But, large amount of training data preparation is an expensive operation and it restricts the ability to adapt to different situations quickly and easily. Therefore, it is worth focusing on how the models can be improved to learn using small amount of training data while obtaining high accuracy. 
In summary, the focused problem(s), focused areas and required skills and knowledge for this research are as follows.
?	focused problem(s) ? How can we develop a machine learning model to identify informative social media contents with sufficient accuracy and ability to learn using small sized training data?
?	focused areas ? machine learning, deep learning, transfer learning, social media (e.g. Twitter)
?	required skills and knowledge ? programming skills (e.g. Python), self-learning skills, basic understanding on machine learning and deep learning concepts, basic understanding on social media",9,,
Paraphrase detection in Twitter,"A paraphrase is also known as a rewrite which expresses the same meaning using different words. Paraphrases are common in the context of social media due to the diverse user base. For an example, both phrases: ?Aaaaaaaaand stephen curry is on fire? and ?What an incredible performance from Stephen Curry? express the same idea.  To mention the importance of paraphrase detection, it can support improving a lot of tasks related to natural language processing (NLP) such as event detection, text normalisation, information retrieval, text summarisation and question answering. 
Referring to the recent literature, there are various approaches which are based on traditional machine learning methods [4] [5] as well as deep neural networks [6]. However, it is worth to further analyse how the accuracy of available methods can be improved, considering the wide range of applications which can be improved using proper paraphrase detection. In summary, the focused problem(s), focused areas and required skills and knowledge for this research are as follows.
?	focused problem(s) ? What are the limitations in available paraphrase detection methods and how can we improve them?
?	focused areas ? NLP, machine learning, deep learning, Twitter
?	required skills and knowledge ? programming skills (e.g. Python), self-learning skills, basic understanding on NLP, basic understanding on machine learning and deep learning concepts, basic understanding on social media",9,,
Lexical normalisation for social media text,"It is common to have non-standard words such as informal abbreviations (e.g. tmwr for tomorrow), intentionally modified words (e.g. goaaalll for goal) and incorrectly spelled words (e.g. documnt for document) in social media text because they are user-generated. But these inclusions degrade the accuracy of many natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) tasks. Therefore, a method which can normalise text (convert non-standard text to standard form) is beneficial for both areas NLP and IR. 
Referring to recent literature, available text normalisation techniques are powered by techniques such as rules [7], neural networks [8] and transformers [9]. Even though the majority of text normalisation methods are only focused on accuracy, it is important to preserve the universality also, without limiting only to specific domains or platforms, so that a wide range of applications can be supported. Further, it is worth if text normalisation can be used with multiple languages.
In summary, the focused problem(s), focused areas and required skills and knowledge for this research are as follows.
?	focused problem(s) ? How can we developed an improved text normalization solution with the focus on accuracy, universality and multiple language support?
?	focused areas ? NLP, machine learning, deep learning, social media (e.g. Twitter)
?	required skills and knowledge ? programming skills (e.g. Python), self-learning skills, basic understanding on NLP, basic understanding on machine learning and deep learning concepts, basic understanding on social media.",9,,
Text-based geolocation prediction for Twitter,"Due to the huge amount of its availability, social media data is considered as an important resource for opinion and news extraction. The use of data can be improved by partitioning them into geographical sub-groups. For examples, grouped data can facilitate the tasks such as local event detection, local security monitoring, geographically-bounded advertising and local recommendations. Even though most of the social media services allow users to insert geographical data separately, the information are missing in majority of documents. Therefore, there is a tendency to extract the location details from text.
Referring to recent literature, there exist different approaches which are based on the techniques such as traditional machine learning [10] [11] and neural networks [12]. However, it is worth to further analyse how the performance of available methods can be improved, considering the wide range of applications which can be improved with location details. In summary, the focused problem(s), focused areas and required skills and knowledge for this research are as follows.
?	focused problem(s) ? What are the limitations in available text-based geolocation prediction methods and how can we improve them?
?	focused areas ? data mining, machine learning, deep learning, Twitter

Home Care System,"How to deal with ageing society? This is one of biggest challenges facing governments as pointed out in the Lund Declaration of 2009. In fact, between the year 2000 and 2050, it is estimated that the population of over 60s will increase from 11% to 22%. This means an increase from 605 Million to 2 Billion over the same period. The population of 80s-90s people will also have an incredible increase: from 100 Million in 2000 to 395 Million in 2050.  Therefore, care of elderly people in their own homes will become a major concern and industry.

The objective of this project is to design and build a system to help the monitor the home environment of elderly or disabled people. For example, the temperature of the building or prolonged periods of inactivity.  Furthermore, this system will need to be adaptive and able to connect to different types of sensors.

The system will comprise of environmental sensors, a hub to assimilate parameters and a web-based monitoring system.",10,,
Voice Recognition for Legacy IR control Device,"In recent years, with the technological advances, the number of new smart home assistants has increased considerably. The most common are Alexa or Google Home, each being capable of voice interaction to set alarms, provide information from the Internet, etc. Most of these smart devices may also be used to control home devices such as TVs through WiFi or Bluetooth. However, many homes still have older devices controlled by traditional IR controls. To control these older devices by voice control we need to generate the IR codes from voice commands.

The aim of this project is to build a system that generates IR codes for a specific device directed by voice commands. A small processor such as a Raspberry Pi will be used to host voice recognition software and interface to IR code generation and driver software.  Options of local and web-based voice recognition will be explored and critically evaluated.",10,,

Developing a method for link prediction in heterogeneous information networks,"Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) refer to logical networks involving entities of multiple types and their multiple relations. HINs are widely used for modelling real-world systems with rich features and intricate patterns. Link prediction in such networks is an interesting research question due to its methodological and practical implication in the business field. This project will involve researching existing methods for link prediction in HINs and finding ways for improving their performance on publicly available benchmarks such as WordNet, MovieLens and DBLP. The project requires Python programming skills and understanding the main machine learning concepts and deep learning architectures, all of which will be taught in the 1st semester",18,,
Developing a method for detecting movement quality. Many recent applications rely on motion and gesture recognition,"Examples include remote patient monitoring and rehabilitation, sports performance analysis, biometric authentication, emotion analysis, performing arts, gaming and virtual reality. In such applications, establishing not only what is being performed (i.e. the type of movement such as arm-raising) but also how (i.e. the quality of movement such as slow arm-raising) is required. This project will involve developing a taxonomy for quantifying movement quality and a deep learning model for automatic movement quality recognition. The project requires Python programming skills and understanding the main machine learning concepts and deep learning architectures, all of which will be taught in the 1st semester.",18,,
Investigating the connection between social mimicry and empathy,"This project is in collaboration with the Faculty of Health, Education and Life Sciences and will involve analysing data related to facial expressions and Empathy Quotient scores collected from 85 subjects in attempt to understand how different people connect with others during social interactions.  The project requires Python programming skills and understanding basic statistical analysis and data visualisation techniques.",18,,
Maximizing Customer Efficiency Through the Use of Digitalization of Restaurant Processes,"Description: 
Due to COVID-19, social distancing is very important in this new normal. To help promote social distancing between employees and customers, I will be creating a website application that enables customers to make their orders by scanning a QR code that will be on their allocated table. From the website app, they will also be able to request the employee?s attention to their table and request the bill for their total order. Customers can also use the website to book their table in advance. There will also be a QR code outside the restaurant for those who are just walking in, which when scanned, will take them to a virtual queue so they won?t have to wait in the lobby near other customers also waiting. This website will make the customer?s experience easier for them and puts the customer?s health and safety first. 

 

Restaurant Website Application ? Key Features: 

Simple ordering system, tap the items you want and press order. 
Menu divided up into categories for easier navigation on the website. 
Function to filter menu to suit customers? dietary/allergy requirements. 
Ability to request waiter?s attention and for the total bill for their order. 
Book tables in advance.
